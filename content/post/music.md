Some cool Rock and Metal Bands, I like to listen to:

## Rock
### Feuerschwanz
A german folk rock band, with electrifying melody.

## Power Metal

### Alestorm
A really fun band, whose songs are based on a pirate theme.

### Gloryhammer
Gloryhammer has a rather different concept for their albums.

Most metal bands design albums, which are disconnected from each other, but not Gloryhammer.
Each song and album is part of a bigger story.

## Death Metal

### Avatar
My absolute favorite metal band. Nearly every song is unique. 
The style between different albums is distinct and they are incredible live.

### Eluveitie
A swiss folk death metal band.

Even though the early albums of Eluveitie had the problem, that the songs sounded rather similar, the new album was completely different.
